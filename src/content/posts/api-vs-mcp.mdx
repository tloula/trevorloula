I keep seeing this question everywhere: *Why use MCP rather than just giving an LLM an OpenAPI spec and a single tool to make API requests?*.

> If you're new to MCP, checkout my [introductory article on MCP](/blog/what-is-mcp) before diving into the differences between APIs and MCP servers.

Here's my list of reasons that I regularly update:

- **Context**: The `C` in MCP stands for Context. MCP servers provide context on each tool / resource they expose for the LLM to understand how to use them. Yes, some OpenAPI specs include good documentation, but many don't.

- **Cost**: Have you seen an OpenAPI spec? They tend to be massive. Passing the entire spec to an LLM would be rather expensive. Some back-of-the-envelope math: [MCP Fabric's rather small OpenAPI spec](https://api.mcpfabric.com/openapi.json) is 20,000 tokens. At [$3/million tokens](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/pricing) for Claude 4, that's $0.06 just to include the spec in the context window.

- **Simplicity & Determinism**: MCP enforces a simple and unified structure for agents to use external tools. APIs are complicated: parameters can be placed in the path, query, headers, or body. With MCP, tools are all discovered in a standardized way. With an API spec, the LLM would be presented with an overwhelming number of options and may struggle to produce consistent results.

- **No Spec**: A surprising number of APIs don't actually have an OpenAPI spec. Why this is when they can be auto-generated is beyond me.

- **Additional Capabilities**: While most current remote MCP servers are mostly just wrappers around existing APIs, the official MCP spec allows for more advanced capabilities that wouldn't be possible with a simple rest API. For example, MCP resources allow for [streaming real-time resource updates](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources#resource-updates) to the agent.

- **Beyond APIs**: MCP isn't limited to APIs - it supports arbitrary functions and can be used to integrate with countless systems. Think shell commands, database queries, file system operations, operating system integration. Microsoft just announced [native support for MCP in Windows](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/agentic/) allowing windows apps to expose their functionality directly to agents.

- **Small Language Models**: Many people see a future where every smart device has an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) running a SLM (Small Language Model). The small language model could then use MCP to interface with hardware on the device. For example, a car could use MCP to interface with the car's sensors and controls.

- **Auth**: Auth to APIs is complicated. Sure, an LLM could figure it out, but MCP provides a standardized way to handle this.

### API -> MCP

If you're looking to create an MCP server from an existing API, check out my [API -> MCP](/blog/api-to-mcp) article that covers the many options available to do so.

### Additional Reading

Frank from Glama AI wrote an excellent [MCP vs API](https://glama.ai/blog/2025-06-06-mcp-vs-api) article. He's active on the MCP subreddits and must have seen many of the same questions I saw that prompted me to write this post. His article focus more on the foundational differences, while mine focuses more on the real-world ramifications of these differences.

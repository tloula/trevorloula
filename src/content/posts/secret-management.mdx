How do you manage your app's backend secrets?

- Hardcoding secrets and committing them to git? ðŸ˜¨
- Manually populating a local .env file with every repo clone? ðŸ˜‘
- Or using a centralized secret management service? ðŸ‘Œ

### What is a secret?

To ensure we're on the same page: a secret is simply a piece of sensitive information used for authentication or authorization â€” think API keys, passwords, connection strings, etc.

> Random note: UUIDs are not considered secrets. They are not secure enough.

And a friendly reminder: hardcoding secrets in your code is a major no-go.

### Secret Management Services

A secret management service offers you a secure, centralized spot to store all your secrets. Major cloud providers offer their own solutions:

- **[Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/overview)**
- **[AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)**
- **[Google Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager)**

Your app simply needs to authenticate with the secret management service, and then it can easily retrieve all its secrets.

### Platform Managed Credentials

Static secrets have some big drawbacks:

- Rotation difficulties: Changing a secret quickly and regularly can be a real hassle.
- Lack of expiration: They usually don't automatically expire. Which means if compromised, they grant indefinite access until rotated.

Enter platform managed credentials. Rather than using a static key, you let your app use role-based access control to request short-lived tokens (generally 1 hour). For example, rather than giving your app a permanent storage account key, you can configure your cloud provider to issue a token after verifying your app's identity. This way, even if a token is compromised, its short lifespan limits the risk.

#### Tokens

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact way to authenticate between services without over-relying on static secrets. A JWT typically has three parts:

- Header: Basic info about the token type and the algorithm used.
- Payload: Contains claims, such as user identity or service roles.
- Signature: Verifies the tokenâ€™s integrity using a secret or key.

In practice, an Authorization Server (like Azure Entra, Auth0, or Clerk) issues these tokens after verifying credentials, while a Resource Server (such as Azure Storage or Azure Key Vault) validates them before granting access.

This token mechanism helps manage secrets by eliminating the need for long-lived, hardcoded credentials. Instead, services exchange short-lived tokens, reducing risks if a token is compromised.

### Auth Flow

Authentication can feel like a chicken-and-egg problem â€” you need a secret to access your secrets. Here's my approach for authentication with a secret management service:

- Development: My app runs locally and uses my developer credentials (e.g., via the Azure CLI).
- Production: My app runs in the cloud and leverages a platform managed credential (like Azure's managed identity).

By combining platform managed credentials with a secret management service, you can keep static secrets out of your codebase and environment variables entirely.

### Best Practices

- **Evaluate Credential Options First**: Before creating a secret, check if you can use platform managed credentials instead. If you're authenticating between services within the same cloud provider, this should be possible. For third-party API interactions, this generally isn't feasible and you'll have to settle for a secret.

- **Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege**: When creating a secret or a role assignment, assign only the minimum privileges required. For example, if your app needs to read images from a storage account, it should only have read permission on your `/images` container. It should not have read/write access to both `/images` and `/sensitive-data`. Grant only what is needed. Developers often overprivilege during initial development and forget to tighten security later. Start lean to mitigate potential risks and save yourself a headache later.

- **Keep Secrets Out of Logs**: Always ensure your secrets remain secret. Avoid logging them or assigning them to variables that might be captured by your logging infrastructure.

### Conclusion

Secret management is a crucial part of modern software development. By leveraging platform managed credentials and a secret management service, you can keep your app secure and your codebase clean.

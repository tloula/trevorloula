> **AI Slop:** low-quality, AI-generated content that floods the internet, often with the primary goal of generating ad revenue or manipulating search engine rankings. It's often characterized by a lack of originality, accuracy, or purpose, resembling spam in its tendency to overwhelm and clutter online spaces.

## How It Started

Back in 2023 when AI was new it felt magical. It was a completely novel concept and everyone was figuring out what it could do.

## How It's Going

Now in 2025, we expect AI to be able to do anything and everything - yet it's abilities are lagging far behind our expectations.

Hustlers are using it to generate mass content. Enterprises expect it to drastically increase their employee's productivity and are out-of-touch with the reality that AI can't yet produce quality content.

## The Fallout

Now everywhere I look is AI slop: Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, random websites... I'll often land on an article from Google and then scramble to get the heck outta there when I quickly realize it's inaccurate, AI-generated garbage.

I see countless posts along the lines of *"I used AI to generate 5000 blog posts"*. No - please stop.

## The Response

Now it's gotten so bad that the term *AI slop* is becoming mainstream. It's not uncommon to see people roasting content with telltale signs of AI: lots of emojis, em dashes (â€“), words like *seamlessly*, etc.

Yet many people still consume AI-generated content. And search engines and algorithms reward quantity over quality.

## My Experience

I tried using AI to polish some of my first articles - it didn't go well. It ripped out my personality, removed stuff that I had intentionally added, and added new stuff that was inaccurate. From that point on I decided to not use AI at all for writing my articles - and the results have been much better. At most I'll use it to proofread and suggest changes, but I try to avoid copypasting anything it spits out.

## The Future

I certainly hope that there's an end to this madness. People will become more picky about the content they consume. Blatant AI-generated content on social media will be called out and downvoted into oblivion. AI will continue to improve and become less horrible.

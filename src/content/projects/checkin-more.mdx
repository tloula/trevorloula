CheckIn More is a mobile app for automated, scheduled virtual wellness checks.

The idea behind CheckIn More came from family who were looking for a more consistent and automated method of checking in on their elderly parents.
Something more practical than texting "Are you alive?" every day...

The idea seemed simple enough: push notifications to check-in, that if missed would text your contacts.

In reality: designing a mobile app for both Android & iOS with a backend that continually monitors for missed check-ins is no small feat.

After months of late nights & lots of coffee, the apps are finally live on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/checkin-more/id6748661948) and [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hydroxygenlabs.armedis) ðŸŽ‰

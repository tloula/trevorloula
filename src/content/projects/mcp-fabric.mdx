APIs are the backbone of the internet — and most MCP servers are just wrappers around existing APIs. The problem? Everyone is manually building these wrappers and running them locally or painfully setting up their own hosting.

I got tired of that, so I built MCP Fabric.

It lets you spin up fully hosted MCP servers instantly — just point it at an OpenAPI spec or define routes yourself. It handles the deployment, hosting, and telemetry (with logs + insights for every tool call -> API request). No code. No setup hell. Just a live, ready-to-use MCP server with tools and resources exposed.

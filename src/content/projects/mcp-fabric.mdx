## About

APIs are the backbone of the internet — and most MCP servers are just wrappers around existing APIs. The problem? Everyone is manually building these wrappers and running them locally or painfully setting up their own hosting.

I built MCP Fabric to fix that.

It lets you spin up fully hosted MCP servers instantly — just point it at an OpenAPI spec or define routes yourself. It handles the deployment, hosting, and telemetry (with logs + insights for every tool call -> API request). No code. No setup hell. Just a live, ready-to-use MCP server with tools and resources exposed.

## Motivation

I first learned about MCP in spring 2025, shortly after the spec was "finalized". I saw the problem that everyone was manually building MCP servers wrapping APIs, and thought it'd be cool to build a platform that automates this.

Yes, I know MCP servers are meant to be much more than simple API wrappers (and have an article on it here: [MCP vs API](../blog/api-vs-mcp)), but many people are still looking to whip together MCP servers using existing APIs.

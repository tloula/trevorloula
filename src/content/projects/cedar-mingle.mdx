Cedar Mingle went viral in my tiny school at saw around 1/8 of the student body create accounts.

## Ancient History

I created Cedar Mingle over the course of ~7 weeks during the height of the rona lockdowns.
I launched a couple weeks into the fall semester of my Senior year of college.
I wasn't sure what to expect - and was shocked that it went viral and became the talk of the school.

While no longer maintained, it was an extremely educational and fulfilling experience.

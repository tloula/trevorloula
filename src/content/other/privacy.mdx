## Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how Trevor Loula ("I", "me", or "my") collects, uses, and shares your personal information when you visit my website (the "Site"). By using the Site, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## Information Collection and Use
While using my Site, I may collect certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:

- Email address (if you choose to contact me)
- Usage data
- Device information
- Browser type and version
- Time and date of your visit
- Pages you visit on my Site

## Analytics and Tracking
I use the following third-party services to analyze and improve the Site:

### Google Analytics
Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of my Site. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.

You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Site available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.

### Microsoft Clarity
Microsoft Clarity is a user behavior analytics tool that helps me understand how users interact with my website. It collects information such as:

- Mouse movements, clicks, and scrolling behavior
- Page views and navigation patterns
- Session recordings (heatmaps and session replays)

This information is used to improve the user experience and functionality of my website. Microsoft Clarity's privacy policy can be found at [https://clarity.microsoft.com/privacy](https://clarity.microsoft.com/privacy).

## Cookies and Similar Technologies
I use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track activity on my Site and hold certain information. Cookies are files with a small amount of data that may include an anonymous unique identifier. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

The cookies I use include:

- Essential cookies for site functionality
- Analytics cookies (Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity)
- Preference cookies to remember your settings

## Data Security
The security of your data is important to me, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While I strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Your Rights
Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, including:

- The right to access your personal information
- The right to correct inaccurate information
- The right to request deletion of your information

## Children's Privacy
My Site does not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided me with personal information, please contact me so that I can take necessary actions.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

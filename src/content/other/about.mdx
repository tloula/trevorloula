**Hey, I'm Trevor.** I'm a software engineer who loves learning, building things, and sharing what I know. I currently work at Microsoft on Azure, but most of what you'll find here comes from the ideas and projects I explore on my own. I'm especially interested in security, authentication, observability, and the core fundamentals that make software reliable.

I enjoy explaining complex concepts in a way that's easy to understand. Check out my [blog](/blog) for my latest thoughts or my [projects](/projects) to see what I've been building. I use this site to document what I'm learning and to share things I wish I had found earlier in my career.

If you want to follow along, I'm on Twitter/X at [@trevorloula](https://twitter.com/trevorloula).
